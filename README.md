# About Me

Since I was a kid web-development was my passion. I still remember when I used the internet for the first time, it felt magical. I always wondered how does it work? How did created those websites? Luckily in my middle school, I got a chance to learn HTML. Since then, I never stopped.

This passion carried me and, eventually, I also developed interests in other programming languages. I studied new languages, algorithms, all these pretty same fascinations that drove me as a kid. And it was here that I learned how much there was yet to learn.

So, now, I'm working hard, hoping one day I will see myself as a full-stack developer.

**Languages:** C/C++, Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, shell command.</br>
